### AI Ranking Implementation for Resume Evaluation

**Overview:**
The AI ranking system is designed to evaluate job applications based on their alignment with job requirements. It leverages the OpenAI API to analyze candidates' resumes and provide a score along with an explanation for each candidate. This system enhances the recruitment process by providing data-driven insights into candidate suitability.

**Key Components:**

1. **API Integration:**
   - The system uses the OpenAI API to generate rankings based on job requirements and candidate qualifications.
   - The API key and base URL for the OpenAI service are stored securely in environment variables.

2. **Prompt Construction:**
   - A detailed prompt is constructed that includes:
     - Job title, required skills, experience, and education.
     - A list of candidates with their skills, experience, education, and resume text.
   - The prompt instructs the AI to return a JSON object containing rankings for each candidate.

3. **AI Response Handling:**
   - The response from the AI is expected to be in a specific JSON format, which includes:
     - `candidateId`: The ID of the candidate.
     - `score`: A numerical score representing the candidate's fit for the job (0-100).
     - `explanation`: A brief explanation of the score.
   - The response is parsed, and if any errors occur during parsing, a fallback scoring system is employed.

4. **Fallback Scoring System:**
   - If the AI response cannot be parsed or if the API call fails, a basic scoring function is used to evaluate candidates based on:
     - Skills match: A percentage score based on how many required skills the candidate possesses.
     - Experience match: A score based on the candidate's years of experience compared to the job's requirements.
     - Education match: A score based on whether the candidate's education meets the job's requirements.
   - This ensures that candidates are still evaluated even if the AI service is unavailable.

5. **Integration with Application Controller:**
   - The ranking function is integrated into the application controller, allowing recruiters to request rankings for applications associated with a specific job.
   - The ranked applications are returned in a sorted order based on their scores, providing recruiters with a clear view of the best candidates.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Comprehensive error handling is implemented to manage potential issues with API calls and response parsing.
   - Informative error messages are logged, and fallback mechanisms ensure that the application remains functional even in the event of an error.

**Conclusion:**
The AI ranking system significantly enhances the recruitment process by providing a structured and data-driven approach to evaluating candidates. By integrating AI capabilities, recruiters can make more informed decisions based on objective criteria, ultimately improving the quality of hires.
